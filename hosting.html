<h1 class="heading">Hosting, Servers, and HTTP</h1>

<p>Websites need hosting.</p>
<p>Hosting is web servers which speak the HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>Web browsers use HTTP to talk to the web servers.</p>
<p>HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It prevents servers from pretending to be allowed to serve a website which they don't own.</p>
